## Harvard Introduction to Computer Science Course CS50

I created this repository to monitor my evolution in this course, it contains codes made during classes and some practical activities of the course, 
each folder corresponds to one week of the course.

- Week 0: Activity using Scratch, I created a simple game with the theme of Doom, link if you want to access via web:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/785217357/
  
- Week 1: Activities teaching basic commands like printf, get_string, functions, loops and using the linux terminal to browse files via codespaces.
The files half.c and prime.c inside the Practice Problems folder were practical activities given by the course where the creation of functions and the
use of loops were practiced respectively, inside the file there are comments on how the code works and the part with comment "TODO" is where there are
the changes made by me for the code to work.

- Week 2: The use of arrays, strings, command-line arguments, ctype.h and string.h libraries, among others, was covered. As in Week 1, it has a folder
called Practice Problems with the practical activities that I had to develop, in the code hours.c a code was given to create a function in it that 
adds up the total hours or the average hours per week that a student has been studying in a course, I used arrays inside for loops to do it. In the
no-vowels.c code I had to create from scratch a way to receive command-line arguments and change all vowels of this argument to numbers, for that I
made a function with a for loop using the strlen function from the string.h library as a condition for iterate all letters and I made use of a switch
case and array to perform the change of vowels to numbers. In the password code, I had to create a function that checked if a password had lowercase,
uppercase, numbers and symbols to be valid, again I did a for loop using the strlen function and did if and else if with several new functions from
the library ctype.h (which I had to research) to do the checks.
